class Kelly_Criterion:
    
    '''
    This class uses the Kelly Criterion to calculate how much of a trader's capital should
    be put into a single trade (as a percentage). See the 'Key Algorithms' section of the
    'Design' part of the project documentation to view the formula for the Kelly Criterion,
    or to understand how it works.
        
    Variables named with only a letter (self.w, self.r & self.k) refer to the
    one-letter value with which that variable is presented in the mathematical
    representation of the formula. For example, self.w refers to the historical
    win percentage of a trading system, which is represented as 'W' or 'w' in
    mathematical representations.
